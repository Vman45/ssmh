# Valve datasheets

This directory contains at least one datasheet for each of the valves used in the schematics:

* 12AU7
* 12AX7
* 12SR7
* 12SR7GT
* 12SW7
* 17EW8
* 19J6

I downloaded these from one of the following two sites whilst preparing the schematics:

* [electron Tube Data sheets][tube-sheets]
* [Valve Museum][valve-museum]
